# Final-Project-Tableau
Data Visualization in Tableau.
## Project/Goals
.Visualization of trends in Tuberculosis Burden dataset[TD_Burden_Country.csv].
.Detecting regions and countries with high TB and HIV positive cases.
.Identifying years of high death rate caused by TB in HIV positive cases across all the regions.
.Developing insights into the trends of estimated Death rate from TB and HIV in various regions.
.Identify  the first 6 countries with the highest death rate in TB cases who are HIV positive.
.Detecting  regions and countries with  estimated TB prevalence above 2,500,000


## Process
.Download and import the dataset.
.Connect the data into Tableau.
.Verify different data types in the dataset.
.Find patterns, trends and detect significant keypoints.
.Generate new relevant questions for data analysis.
.Analyse the data using trendlines, outliers, forecast. etc
.Dashboard creation.
. 
## Results
***List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. 
The dataset I selected is [TD_Burden_Country.csv] and it include the following features
1:- Country or territory name
2:- Year
3:-Region
4:- Estimated total population number.
5:- Estimated prevalence of TB (all forms) per 100 000 population.
6:- Estimated prevalence of TB (all forms).
7:- Method to derive prevalence estimates.
8:- Estimated number of deaths from TB (all forms, excluding HIV).
9:- Estimated number of deaths from TB which are HIV positive.
10:- Case detection rate (all forms), percent.

***Discuss the visualizations you created, and why.
I created the following visualization
1: TB cases detected per year with corresponding incident cases.
2: Map of incident TB cases per 100000 population for all countries.
3: Map showing the country with the highest incident case.
4: Regions with estimated number of death by TB in HIV positive cases.
5: Estimated population of all regions.
6: Average region incident and prevalence of TB with HIV positive cases.
7: Map showing estimated mortality rate of TB cases all forms.
8: Region estimated death rate of TB cases who are HIV positive.
9: Estimated numbers of TB prevalence detected by different methods at different years in all regions.
10: Estimates of regions and countries with TB incident cases.
11:Countries indicating high estimated death by TB in HIV positive cases.
12:Scattered plots indicating countries within regions that are outliers.
13: Years with the highest death rate from countries in different regions.
14:Prediction for regions and countries with the highest number of death by TB with HIV positive cases.
15:Countries in regions death rate trendlines of TB and HIV positive cases.
16:Region  outliers.
17:First 6 countries and their regions with the highest death rate caused by TB in HIV positive cases.
18: Regions with estimated TB prevalence above 2,500,000.

***I created all these visualization to answer the following questions.
-Detect regions and countries with estimated prevalence of TB with population above 2,500,000.
-Detect regions and countries with high TB and HIV positive cases.
-Identify years of high death rate caused by TB in HIV positive cases across all the regions.
-Develop insights into the trends of estimated Death rate from TB and HIV in various regions.
-Identify  the first 6 countries with the highest death rate from TB cases who are HIV positive.
-Make a prediction for the next 3 years about death rate caused by TB in HIV positive cases across all regions.

 *** All these questions where answered using the visualizations created and the following dashboards.
A: Dashboard on  Region cases  of TB incident and death per year.
B: Dashboard on outlier regions and countries showing incident and death rate by TB and HIV positive cases.
C: Dashboard showing the first 6 countries with the highest number of death from TB in HIV positive cases,forecast and trendlines.

-Overall results show that 5 countries in Africa and and 1 in South Eastern Asia have the highest number of death caused by TB in HIV positive cases.
it is also worthy of noting that according to the forecast, countries like Australia,Iran, USA will have TB deathrate near negligible in years to come.
-Years with the highest rate of death cause by TB in HIV positive cases are between 2002-2004 for most regions.
- The following regions and countries with estimated prevalence of TB with population above 2,500,000. are as follows
    -  Africa(Democratic of Congo, Ethiopia,Nigeria,South Africa),
    - America(Brazil),Emirates(Pakistan),
    - Europe(Russian Federation),
    - South East Asia(Bangladesh, India,Indonesia,Myanmar),
    -  Western Pacific Region(Cambodia, China,Philippinees,Viet Nam)

## Challenges 
.Time constraints to explore available data.
## Future Goals
I will conduct more in-depth statistical analysisto extract valuable insights in the data.
I will explore other datasets that are relevant to the prevalence of TB and HIV positive cases in affected regions,compare the forecast and proffer solution  to help reduce the death rate in those countries.
